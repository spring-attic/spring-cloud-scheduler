= Spring Cloud Scheduler

The Spring Cloud Scheduler project defines an SPI for scheduling short lived tasks.

== Overview
This project offers an interface that abstracts the common functionality
for scheduling ephemeral applications on cloud platforms by using their native schedulers, such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry Scheduler and Kubernetes Cron Job, to schedule applications in Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, respectively.
With the Spring Cloud Scheduler SPI you can implement an application scheduler that will be able to schedule applications for launch by a native scheduler via cron expressions.

== Components

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-scheduler/tree/master/spring-cloud-scheduler-spi[SPI] project
defines the core interfaces, that create, delete and list schedules.

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-scheduler/tree/master/spring-cloud-scheduler-spi-test[SPI Test] project provides
the basic test framework that any SPI implementation should use to verify its functionality.

== Implementations

This scheduler SPI has been implemented  https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-scheduler-cloudfoundry[Cloud Foundry].

The following image shows a basic architecture of an implementation:
